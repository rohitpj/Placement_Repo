    "\n",
    "This data set is created by [Uber Movement](https://movement.uber.com/) project, which includes the average speed on a given road segment for each hour of each day in April 2019. In this data set, there are about 220,000 road segments (with different directions). Note that this data set only includes road segments with at least 5 unique trips in that hour. There are up to 73.09% missing values and most missing values are produced during night. We could preferably choose the subset of this raw data set into a time series matrix of $35912\\times720$ in which each time series has at least 70% observations.\n"
